* Settings
** Deletion
Countdowns could be automatically "deleted" based on per-countdown setting or global configuration. Deletion could be just normal deletion of the file or the file could be moved to a "graveyard" directory with old countdowns archived.
Deletion should probably have a grace period, meaning it'd only get deleted automatically after some time.
